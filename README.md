  This Git repository has four folders which each contain code to make a map and code to test functions within that folder. 
  
As an example, each folder contains a seismic event mapper for the California region that displays the locations of earthquakes that occured from 1975-2022. In each mapper, users are able to specify co-ordinates, the physical features displayed (e.g. lakes, oceans, rivers) and the minimum magnitude of the earthquakes displayed. Each map displays the earthquakes in a colour-graded system that shows depth, as well a sea-floor layer that displays age.

I will add more to this 

  
  To make one of the maps, open one of the folders and run "MapMaker.ipnyb". To run the tests, open "RunTests.ipnyb" in a folder and run ! pytest. Sourcecode is available in each folder under /src.
