  This Git repository has four folders which each contain code to make a map and code to test functions within that folder. 
  
  To make one of the maps, open one of the folders and run "MapMaker.ipnyb". To run the tests, open "RunTests.ipnyb" in a folder and run ! pytest. Sourcecode is available in each folder under src/.
